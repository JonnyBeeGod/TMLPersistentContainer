// Routines for finding the correct route through the graph.
//
// We model this as a shortest-path problem and solve using Bellman-Ford
// because of negative weights[1].
//
// Requirement is loosely to never to skip explicit mapping models.
// More precisely:
// - always prefer a path with mapping models over one with inferred edges,
//   even if inferred path has fewer edges
// - given two paths both with mapping models, choose the one with fewer
//   edges.
//
// Path 'distance' is modelled by the Distance struct that describes how many
// of each type of edge it contains.  The < relation on it implements the
// requirements above.
//
// [1] ie. 'things can get better' - if we have a path (e:0 i:3) and discover
//     a new path of (e:0 i:4) we cannot prune that search (as in Dijkstra)
//     because we may discover a further path of (e:1 i:4) which is "shorter"
//     than (e:0 i:3)
//
// This code is factored out from the core-data depenent classes for easier
// testing.
//
// (not a generically useful graph library!)
